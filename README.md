# Sentiment Analysis of 10-Q Filings Using Custom Financial Dictionaries

This project implements a textual analysis framework to evaluate the tone of corporate 10-Q filings, focusing on financial sentiment. The analysis leverages the Loughran-McDonald (2011) financial word list and compares it with the Harvard-IV dictionary, highlighting the differences in sentiment classification between financial and general-purpose word lists.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to assess how the tone of 10-Q filings correlates with excess stock returns around the filing date, using both financial and general negative word lists. This involves:
- Textual analysis of 10-Q filings using custom financial sentiment dictionaries.
- Calculation of 4-day excess stock returns following 10-Q filings.
- Comparison of results obtained from the Loughran-McDonald and Harvard word lists.

## Data
The project processes S&P 500 constituent data and 10-Q filings downloaded from the SEC. It utilizes historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance to compute excess returns.

### Input Files:
1. **sp500_CIKS.csv**: Contains CIK and Ticker mappings for S&P 500 companies.
2. **NEGLoughranMcDonald_MasterDictionary_2018NEG.csv**: The Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment dictionary.
3. **Harvard_Negative_Words_List.txt**: The Harvard-IV dictionary for sentiment analysis.
4. **sp500_closing_prices.csv**: Historical stock prices for S&P 500 companies.
5. **10-Q HTML files**: 10-Q filings downloaded from the SEC.

## Key Components
1. **Word Count Analysis**: Parses 10-Q filings and counts occurrences of sentiment-related words from both the Loughran-McDonald and Harvard word lists.
3. **Tone vs. Return Correlation**: Analyzes the correlation between sentiment scores and excess returns, grouped into quintiles based on negative sentiment scores.

## Usage
1. Run `10Q_html_downloader.py` to download all the 10Qs of the S&P500 constitutents 
2. Run `10Q_extractor.py` to extract the text from the downloaded 10Qs
3. Run `Generic_Parser.py` to get word count and other intermediate computations; returns a `Parser.csv` file.
4. Run `get_sp500_closing_data.py` to get S&P500 closing prices
5. Run `get_sp500_cik.py` to get S&P500 CIK
6. Run `sentiment_analysis_results.py` to compute the 10Q weights and visualize the trend of negative sentiment v/s 4 day cumulative returns

## Dependencies
Install the env: `SentimentAnalysis_LoughranMcDonald_env.yml` 

## Results
The project demonstrates that financial-specific word lists, such as the Loughran-McDonald list, provide a more accurate measure of negative sentiment in 10-Q filings than general-purpose dictionaries like Harvard-IV. The analysis also shows a significant relationship between the negative tone of a 10-Q and the corresponding 4-day stock price reaction.
